the
iliad
of
homer
rendered
into
english
blank
verse
by
edward
earl
of
derby
preface
in
the
spring
of
i
was
induced
at
the
request
of
some
personal
friends
to
print
for
private
circulation
only
a
small
volume
of
translations
of
poems
ancient
and
modern
in
which
was
included
the
first
book
of
the
iliad
the
opinions
expressed
by
some
competent
judges
of
the
degree
of
success
which
had
attended
this
attempt
to
infuse
into
an
almost
literal
english
version
something
of
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
simplicity
of
the
great
original
footnote
introduction
to
unpublished
volume
were
sufficiently
favourable
to
encourage
me
to
continue
the
work
which
i
had
begun
it
has
afforded
me
in
the
intervals
of
more
urgent
business
an
unfailing
and
constantly
increasing
source
of
interest
and
it
is
not
without
a
feeling
of
regret
at
the
completion
of
my
task
and
a
sincere
diffidence
as
to
its
success
that
i
venture
to
submit
the
result
of
my
labour
to
the
ordeal
of
public
criticism
various
causes
irrespective
of
any
demerits
of
the
work
itself
forbid
me
to
anticipate
for
this
translation
any
extensive
popularity
first
i
fear
that
the
taste
for
and
appreciation
of
classical
literature
are
greatly
on
the
decline
next
those
who
have
kept
up
their
classical
studies
and
are
able
to
read
and
enjoy
the
original
will
hardly
take
an
interest
in
a
mere
translation
while
the
english
reader
unacquainted
with
greek
will
naturally
prefer
the
harmonious
versification
and
polished
brilliancy
of
pope
s
translation
with
which
as
a
happy
adaptation
of
the
homeric
story
to
the
spirit
of
english
poetry
i
have
not
the
presumption
to
enter
into
competition
but
admirable
as
it
is
pope
s
iliad
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
homer
s
iliad
and
there
may
be
some
who
having
lost
the
familiarity
with
the
original
language
which
they
once
possessed
may
if
i
have
at
all
succeeded
in
my
attempt
have
recalled
to
their
minds
a
faint
echo
of
the
strains
which
delighted
their
earlier
days
and
may
recognize
some
slight
trace
of
the
original
perfume
numerous
as
have
been
the
translators
of
the
iliad
or
of
parts
of
it
the
metres
which
have
been
selected
have
been
almost
as
various
the
ordinary
couplet
in
rhyme
the
spenserian
stanza
the
trochaic
or
ballad
metre
all
have
had
their
partisans
even
to
that
pestilent
heresy
of
the
so
called
english
hexameter
a
metre
wholly
repugnant
to
the
genius
of
our
language
which
can
only
be
pressed
into
the
service
by
a
violation
of
every
rule
of
prosody
and
of
which
notwithstanding
my
respect
for
the
eminent
men
who
have
attempted
to
naturalize
it
i
could
never
read
ten
lines
without
being
irresistibly
reminded
of
canning
s
dactylics
call
st
thou
them
god
help
thee
silly
one
but
in
the
progress
of
this
work
i
have
been
more
and
more
confirmed
in
the
opinion
which
i
expressed
at
its
commencement
that
whatever
may
be
the
extent
of
my
own
individual
failure
if
justice
is
ever
to
be
done
to
the
easy
flow
and
majestic
simplicity
of
the
grand
old
poet
it
can
only
be
in
the
heroic
blank
verse
i
have
seen
isolated
passages
admirably
rendered
in
other
metres
and
there
are
many
instances
in
which
a
translation
line
for
line
and
couplet
for
couplet
naturally
suggests
itself
and
in
which
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
avoid
an
involuntary
rhyme
but
the
blank
verse
appears
to
me
the
only
metre
capable
of
adapting
itself
to
all
the
gradations
if
i
may
use
the
term
of
the
homeric
style
from
the
finished
poetry
of
the
numerous
similes
in
which
every
touch
is
nature
and
nothing
is
overcoloured
or
exaggerated
down
to
the
simple
almost
homely
style
of
some
portions
of
the
narrative
least
of
all
can
any
other
metre
do
full
justice
to
the
spirit
and
freedom
of
the
various
speeches
in
which
the
old
warriors
give
utterance
without
disguise
or
restraint
to
all
their
strong
and
genuine
emotions
to
subject
these
to
the
trammels
of
couplet
and
rhyme
would
be
as
destructive
of
their
chief
characteristics
as
the
application
of
a
similar
process
to
the
paradise
lost
of
milton
or
the
tragedies
of
shakespeare
the
effect
indeed
may
be
seen
by
comparing
with
some
of
the
noblest
speeches
of
the
latter
the
few
couplets
which
he
seems
to
have
considered
himself
bound
by
custom
to
tack
on
to
their
close
at
the
end
of
a
scene
or
an
act
i
have
adopted
not
without
hesitation
the
latin
rather
than
the
greek
nomenclature
for
the
heathen
deities
i
have
been
induced
to
do
so
from
the
manifest
incongruity
of
confounding
the
two
and
from
the
fact
that
though
english
readers
may
be
familiar
with
the
names
of
zeus
or
aphrodite
or
even
poseidon
those
of
hera
or
ares
or
hephaestus
or
leto
would
hardly
convey
to
them
a
definite
signification
it
has
been
my
aim
throughout
to
produce
a
translation
and
not
a
paraphrase
not
indeed
such
a
translation
as
would
satisfy
with
regard
to
each
word
the
rigid
requirements
of
accurate
scholarship
but
such
as
would
fairly
and
honestly
give
the
sense
and
spirit
of
every
passage
and
of
every
line
omitting
nothing
and
expanding
nothing
and
adhering
as
closely
as
our
language
will
allow
ever
to
every
epithet
which
is
capable
of
being
translated
and
which
has
in
the
particular
passage
anything
of
a
special
and
distinctive
character
of
the
many
deficiencies
in
my
execution
of
this
intention
i
am
but
too
conscious
whether
i
have
been
in
any
degree
successful
must
be
left
to
the
impartial
decision
of
such
of
the
public
as
may
honour
this
work
with
their
perusal
d
knowsley
oct
note
to
the
fifth
edition
the
favourable
reception
which
has
been
given
to
the
first
editions
of
this
work
far
exceeding
my
most
sanguine
hopes
affords
a
gratifying
proof
how
far
in
my
preface
i
had
overrated
the
extent
to
which
the
taste
for
and
appreciation
of
classical
literature
had
declined
it
will
not
i
hope
be
thought
extraordinary
that
some
errors
and
inaccuracies
should
have
found
their
way
into
a
translation
executed
i
must
admit
somewhat
hastily
and
with
less
of
the
limae
labor
than
i
should
have
bestowed
upon
it
had
i
ventured
to
anticipate
for
it
so
extensive
a
circulation
my
thanks
therefore
are
due
to
those
critics
who
either
publicly
or
privately
have
called
my
attention
to
passages
in
which
the
sense
of
the
author
has
been
either
incorrectly
or
imperfectly
rendered
all
of
these
i
have
examined
and
have
availed
myself
of
several
of
the
suggestions
offered
for
their
correction
and
a
careful
revision
of
the
whole
work
and
renewed
comparison
with
the
original
have
enabled
me
to
discover
other
defects
the
removal
of
which
will
i
hope
render
the
present
edition
especially
in
the
eyes
of
classical
scholars
somewhat
more
worthy
of
the
favour
which
has
been
accorded

all
were

it

falsifies

bids
me
now
return

frustrate

and
with
grievous

such
now
appears
th
o

sunk

sink

is

tis

indeed
that

should
hear
how
such

as
ours
so
great
so
brave
hath
thus
been
baffled
fighting
as
we
do
gainst
numbers
far
inferior
to
our
own
and
see
no
end
of
all
our
warlike
toil
for
should
we
choose
on

of
plighted
truce
trojans
and

to

all
that
dwell

we
by

no

would
find

to

come

came
remains
undone
hear
then

agree

here
in

thus
address
d
the

what
more
thou

would
st
thou
have
thy

full

in

from

the

we
greeks

we
take
choose
first
of

set
apart
for
thee

thou

perchance

lead
the

ye

i

on

ulysses

in

rebuke
thou
babbling
fool
thersites
prompt
of

restrain
thy

nor
singly
thus
presume
the
kings
to
slander
thou
the
meanest
far
of
all
that
with
the
atridae
came
to
troy
ill
it
beseems
that
such
an
one
as
thou
should
lift
thy
voice
against
the
kings
and
rail
with
scurril
ribaldry
and
prate
of
home
how
these
affairs
may
end
we
know
not
yet
nor
how
or
well

we
may
return
cease
then
against
atrides
king
of

to
pour
thy
spite
for
that
the
valiant
greeks
to
him
despite
thy
railing
as
of
right
an
ample
portion
of
the
spoils
assign
but
this
i
tell
thee
and
will
make
it
good
if
e
er
i
find
thee
play
the
fool
as
now
then
may
these
shoulders
cease
this
head
to
bear
and
may
my
son
telemachus
no
more
own
me
his
father
if
i
strip
not
off
thy
mantle

thy
garments
aye
expose
thy
nakedness
and
flog
thee
to
the
ships
howling
and
scourg
d
with
ignominious
stripes
thus
as
he
spoke
upon
thersites
neck
and
back
came
down
his
heavy
staff
the
wretch
shrank
from
the
blow
and
scalding
tears
let
fall

struck

golden
studded

he
sat

wip
d
away
with
horrible
grimace

greeks
despite
their
anger
laugh
d
aloud

one
to

said

this
scurril
babbler
hold
his
peace
methinks
his
headstrong
spirit
will
not
soon
lead
him
again
to
vilify
the
kings
thus
spoke
the
gen
ral
voice
but
staff
in
hand
ulysses
rose
minerva
by
his
side
in
likeness
of
a
herald
bade
the
crowd
keep
silence
that
the
greeks
from
first
to
last
might
hear
his
words
and
ponder
his
advice
he
thus
with
prudent
phrase
his
speech
began
great
son
of
atreus
on
thy
name
o

throughout
the

will
foul
reproach
be
cast

forget
their

make
good
the
vow
they
took
to
thee
when
hitherward
we
sailed
from
argos
grassy
plains
to
raze
ere
our
return

well
built

but
now
like

gloomy
stream
then
with
deep
groans
th
assembled
greeks
address
d
o
friends
the
chiefs
and
councillors
of
greece
grievous
and
all
unlook
d
for
is
the
blow
which
jove
hath
dealt
me
by
his
promise
led
i
hop
d
to
raze
the
strong
built
walls
of
troy
and
home
return
in
safety
but
it
seems
he
falsifies
his
word
and
bids
me
now
return
to
argos
frustrate
of
my
hope
dishonour
d
and
with
grievous
loss
of
men
such
now
appears
th
o
er
ruling
sov
reign
will
of
saturn
s
son
who
oft
hath
sunk
the
heads
of
many
a
lofty
city
in
the
dust
and
yet
will
sink
for
mighty
is
his
hand
hear
then
my
counsel
let
us
all
agree
home
to
direct
our
course
since
here
in
vain
we
strive
to
take
the
well
built
walls
of
troy
the
monarch
spoke
they
all
in
silence
heard
in
speechless
sorrow
long
they
sat
at
length
rose
valiant
diomed
and
thus
he
spoke
atrides
i
thy
folly
must
confront
as
is
my
right
in
council
thou
o
king
be
not
offended
once
among
the
greeks
thou
heldest
light
my
prowess
with
the
name
of
coward
branding
me
how
justly
so
is
known
to
all
the
greeks
both
young
and
old
on
thee
the
deep
designing
saturn
s
son
in
diff
ring
measure
hath
his
gifts
bestow
d
a
throne
he
gives
thee
higher
far
than
all
but
valour
noblest
boon
of
heav
n
denies
how
canst
thou
hope
the
sons
of
greece
shall
prove
such
heartless
dastards
as
thy
words
suppose
if
homeward
to
return
thy
mind
be
fix
d
depart
the
way
is
open
and
the
ships
which
from
mycenae
follow
d
thee
in
crowds
are
close
at
hand
and
ready
to
be
launch
d
yet
will
the
other
long
hair
d
greeks
remain
till
priam
s
city
fall
nay
though
the
rest
betake
them
to
their
ships
and
sail
for
home
yet
i
and
sthenelus
we
two
will
fight
till
troy
be
ours
for
heav
n
is
on
our
side
thus
he
the
sons
of
greece
with
loud
applause
the
speech
of
valiant
diomed
confirm
d
then
aged
nestor
rose
and
thus
began
tydides
eminent
thou
art
in

in
the
council
thy
compeers

yield
to

thy

censure

gainsay

yet
the
end
thou
hast
not
reach

thou
art
young

for
thine
age

he
mov

to

aside

we
then
with

the

may
we
launch
in
safety

no

it
is
to
fly
although
by

impending
evil
better
so
to
fly
than
by

threaten
d

be
o

en
to

with

sage
what
words
have
pass
d
the

of

thou
son
of

thou
hadst
been
of
some
ignoble
band
the
leader
not
the
chief
of
such
a
host
as
ours
on
whom
from
youth
to
latest
age
jove
hath
the
gift
bestow
d
to
bear
the
brunt
of
hardy
war
till
ev
ry
man
be
slain
and
think
st
thou
so
to
leave
the
lofty
walls
of
troy
the
object
of
our
painful
toil
be
silent
that
no
other
greek
may
hear
words
which
no
man
might
trust
his
tongue
to
speak
who
nobler
counsels
understands
and
wields
a
royal
sceptre
and
th
allegiance
claims
of
numbers
such
as
those
that
own
thy
sway
thy
counsels
all
i
utterly
condemn
who
mid
the
close
and
clamour
of
the
fight
wouldst
have
us
launch
our
ships
and
give
the
foe
already
too
triumphant
cause
renew
d
for
boasting
then
were
death
our
certain
lot
for
if
the

he
launch
d
not
long
will
greeks
sustain
the
war
but
with
reverted
eyes
shrink
from
the
fight
to
such
pernicious
end
would
lead
thy
baneful
counsels
mighty
chief
whom
answer
d
agamemnon
king
of

ulysses
thy
rebuke
hath
wrung
my
soul

never
meant
i
that
against
their
will
the
sons
of
greece
should
launch
their
well
found
ships
but
if
there
be
who
better
counsel
knows
or
young
or
old
his
words
would
please
me

rose

soe
er

must
change

obedient
to

mine
and
if
in
all
sincerity
thou
speak
go
to
th

gods
and
hither
send
iris
and
phoebus
of
the
silver
bow
that
she
may
to
the
grecian
camp
repair
and
bid
that
neptune
from
the
battle
field
withdraw
and
to
his
own
domain
retire
while
phoebus
hector
to
the
fight
restores
inspiring
new
born
vigour
and
allaying
the
mortal
pains
which
bow
his

down
then
heartless
fear
infusing
in
the

put
them
to
flight
that
flying
they
may
fall
beside

then
patroclus
he
shall
send

slain

not

amid
the
rest
my
son

his

enrag
d

subdue
thenceforth
my
counsel
is
that
from

the

shall
still
be
backward
driv
n
until
at

by

deep

will
spurn

exert
if

will
be

me
so
twere

now
for
a

ambrosial
night
detains
the

of

but
at

morn
if
issuing
forth

he
find
us
here
his

we
shall
know

happy
he
who
flying

in

spoke

he
with

obeying
stood
leaning

the

left

there

went

assuming

him

standing

hast
thou
been
bested
by
fierce
achilles
who
around

thee
with

now
stand
we
both
for

and
his

thus
replied
with

pray

both
our

our

all
successively
implored
me
to
remain
such
fear
is

but
in
my
soul
on
thine
account
too
deep
a
grief
i
felt
now
forward
boldly
spare
we
not
our

make
trial
if
achilles
to
the

from

our
bloody
spoils
can
bear

by

himself
may
be
subdued
thus
pallas
lur

him
on
with
treach
rous
wile
but
when
the
two
were
met
and
close
at

first
spoke
great
hector
of

no
more
before
thee
peleus

i

thrice
have
i
fled
around

nor
dar

thine

now
my
spirit
is
rous
d
to
stand
before
thee
to
be
slain
or

but
let
us
first
th
immortal
gods
invoke
the
surest
witnesses
and
guardians
they
of
compacts
at
my

no
foul
disgrace
shalt
thou
sustain
if
jove
with

shall
crown
my
firm
endurance
and
thy

to
me
be
forfeit
of
thine

stripp

thus
hector
thou
object
of
my
deadly
hate
talk
not
to
me
of
compacts
as

men
and
lions
no
firm
concord
can
exist
nor
wolves
and
lambs
in
harmony
unite
but
ceaseless
enmity
between
them
dwells
so
not
in
friendly

firm
can
thou

i
unite
till
one
of

his

the

thee
of

he
said

poising

hector
saw
and
shunn
d
the

he
stoop
d

o

flew
the

tipp

and
in

was

pallas
drew
the
weapon
forth
and
to
achilles
hand
all
unobserv

gave
it
back
then
hector
thus
to
peleus
matchless

thine

my

thou

son
of

been

d
such
was
indeed
thy

but
flippant
was
thy

subtly
fram

to
scare
me
with
big
words
and
make
me
prove
false
to
my
wonted
prowess

not

through

such

if

he
struck

glancing
from

bounded
off
hector
was
griev

thus
his

aghast

loudly
on

he
was

knew
that

most

who
by

bereft

antilochus
the

espied
it
was
a
gully
where
the
winter

rain
had
lain
collected

had
broken
through
a
length
of
road

hollow
d
out

menelaus
held
his
cautious
course
fearing

antilochus
drawing

a

from

down

in

the

shouted
aloud
antilochus
thou
driv
st
like

hold

grows

thou

here
thou
wilt
but
cause
our

to
clash
and
bring
us
both
to
harm
he
said
but
madlier
drove
antilochus
plying
the
goad
as
though
he
heard
him
not
far
as
a
discus
flight
by
some
stout
youth
that
tests
his
vigour
from
the
shoulder
hurl
d
so
far
they
ran
together
side
by
side
then
dropp
d
atrides
horses
to
the
rear
for
he
himself
forbore
to
urge
their
speed
lest
meeting
in
the
narrow
pass
the

should
be
o
erthrown
and
they
themselves
in
haste
to
gain

vict

then
thus
reproachful
to
antilochus
antilochus
thou
most
perverse
of

beshrew
thy

we

deceiv

who

e

now
thou
shalt
not

on

the

he
said
and
to
his
horses
call
d
aloud
slack
not
your
speed
nor
as
defeated
mourn
their
legs
and
feet
will
sooner
tire
than
yours
for
both
are
past
the
vigour
of
their

thus
he
the
horses
of
his
voice
in
awe
put
forth
their
pow

and
soon
the
leaders
near
d
meanwhile
the
chieftains
seated
in
the
ring
look
d
for
the
cars
that
scour
d
the
dusty
plain
the
first
to
see
them
was
idomeneus
the
cretan
king
for
he
without
the
ring
was
posted
high
aloft
and
from
afar
he
heard
and
knew
the
foremost
horseman
s
voice
well
too
he
knew
the
gallant
horse
that
led
all
bay
the
rest
but
on
his
front
alone
a
star
of
white
full
orbed
as
the
moon
then
up
he
rose
and
thus
the
greeks
address
d
o
friends
the
chiefs
and
councillors
of
greece
can
ye
too
see
or
i
alone
the
cars
a
diff
rent
chariot
seems
to
me
in
front
a
diff
rent
charioteer
and
they
who
first
were
leading
must
have
met
with
some
mischance
i
saw
them
late
ere
round
the
goal
they
turn
d
but
see
them
now
no
more
though
all
around
my
eyes
explore
the
wide
spread
plain
of
troy
perchance
the
charioteer
has
dropp
d
the
reins
or
round
the
goal
he
could
not
hold
the
mares
perchance
has
miss
d
the
turn
and
on
the
plain
is
lying
now
beside
his
broken
car
while
from
the
course
his
mettled
steeds
have
flown
stand
up
and
look
yourselves
i
cannot
well
distinguish
but
to
me
it
seems
a
chief
who
reigns
o
er
greeks
though
of
aetolian
race
the
son
of
tydeus
valiant
diomed
sharply
oileus
active
son
replied
idomeneus
why
thus
before
the
time
so
rashly
speak
while
the
high
stepping
steeds
are
speeding
yet
across
the
distant
plain
thine
eyes
are
not
the
youngest
in
the
camp
nor
look
they
out
the
sharpest
from
thy
head
but
thou
art
ever
hasty
in
thy
speech
and
ill
becomes
thee
this
precipitance
since
others
are
there
here
thy
betters
far
the
same
are
leading
now
that
led
at
first
eumelus
mares
tis
he
that
holds
the
reins
to
whom
in
anger
thus
the
cretan
chief
ajax
at
wrangling
good
in
judgment
naught
and
for
aught
else
among
the
chiefs
of
greece
of
small
account
so
stubborn
is
thy
soul
wilt
thou
a
tripod
or
a
caldron
stake
and
agamemnon
atreus
son
appoint
the
umpire
to
decide
whose
steeds
are
first
so
shalt
thou
gain
thy
knowledge
at
thy
cost
he
said
up
sprang
oileus
active
son
in
anger
to
reply
and
farther
yet
had
gone
the
quarrel
but
achilles
self
stood
up
and
thus
the
rival
chiefs
address
d
forbear
both
ajax
and
idomeneus
this
bitter
interchange
of
wordy
war
it
is
not
seemly
and
yourselves
i
know
another
would
condemn
who
so
should
speak
but
stay
ye
here
and
seated
in
the
ring
their
coming
wait
they
hurrying
to
the
goal
will
soon
be
here
and
then
shall
each
man
know
whose
horses
are
the
second
whose
the
first
thus
he
but
tydeus
son
drew
near
his
lash
still
laid
upon
his
horses
shoulder
points
as
lightly
they
high
stepping
scour
d
the
plain
still
on
the
charioteer
the
dust
was
flung

close
upon
the
flying

gold

inlaid
and
lightly
as
they
flew
along
were
left

the

on

in

down
pouring

paid
end
of
volume
ii
the
end
footnotes
the
text
of
the
original
leaves
it
somewhat
in
doubt
whether
the
anger
of
the
greeks
were
directed
against
thersites
or
agamemnon
i
believe
the
preponderance
of
authority
ancient
and
modern
is
in
favour
of
the
former
interpretation
but
the
latter
is
not
without
the
support
of
some
eminent
scholars
and
after
much
consideration
i
have
been
induced
to
adopt
it
the
original
represents
the
greeks
as
filled
with
anger
and
resentment
against
some
one
thersites
was
an
object
of
general
contempt
but
he
had
done
nothing
to
excite
those
feelings
indeed
apart
from
the
offensiveness
of
his
tone
the
public
sympathy
was
with
him
for
the
army
was
deeply
dissatisfied
and
resented
the
conduct
of
agamemnon
against
achilles
mainly
perhaps
because
they
had
ceased
to
be
enriched
with
the
plunder
of
his
successful
forays
see
i
and
ix
this
dissatisfaction
and
resentment
are
referred
to
by
neptune
xiii
and
by
agamemnon
himself
xiv
they
had
lately
manifested
themselves
in
the
alacrity
with
which
the
whole
army
had
caught
at
the
insidious
suggestion
of
abandoning
the
war
and
just
before
the
second
assembly
thersites
avails
himself
of
the
general
feeling
constituting
himself
the
representative
of
a
popular
grievance
to
vent
his
personal
spite
against
agamemnon
ulysses
saw
how
dangerous
such
a
display
might
be
at
such
a
moment
and
artfully
assuming
line
that
the
feeling
was
confined
to
thersites
alone
though
in
his
subsequent
speech
line
he
admits
and
excuses
the
general
discontent
he
proceeds
to
cut
short
its
expression
by
summary
chastisement
thereupon
the
fickle
multitude
despite
their
anger
against
agamemnon
cannot
refrain
from
laughing
at
the
signal
discomfiture
of
their
self
constituted
champion
this
view
is
very
fully
set
forth
in
a
note
on
the
passage
appended
to
a
translation
of
the
iliad
by
mr
barter
published
in
but
which
i
have
only
seen
since
the
publication
of
this
work
see
also
book
xxii
l
milton
in
the
corresponding
passage
at
the
close
of
the
th
book
of
paradise
lost
reverses
the
sign
and
represents
the
scale
of
the
vanquished
as
flying
up
and
kicking
the
beam
the
fiend
look
d
up
and
knew
his
mounted
scale
aloft
nor
more
but
fled
murm
ring
and
with
him
fled
the
shades
of
night
this
comparison
does
not
afford
a
very
accurate
criterion
of
the
space
interposed
which
cannot
be
estimated
without
knowing
the
total
distance
within
which
the
faster
was
to
outstrip
the
slower
team
this
passage
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
an
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
poet
who
apparently
had
forgotten
that
pylasmenes
the
paphlagonian
chief
had
himself
been
killed
by
menelaus
some
time
before
the
death
of
his
son
see

seqq
i
hope
i
may
be
pardoned
for
having
somewhat
curtailed
the
list
of
these
ladies
which
in
the
original
extends
over
ten
lines
of
names
only
in
doing
so
i
have
followed
the
example
of
virgil
who
represents
the
same
ladies
g
in
attendance
on
cyrene
and
has
not
only
reduced
the
list
but
added
some
slight
touches
illustrating
their
occupations
and
private
history
a
liberty
permissible
to
an
imitator
but
not
to
a
translator
l
chthizos
yesterday
but
either
the
word
must
have
a
more
extended
signification
than
is
usually
given
to
it
or
homer
must
here
have
fallen
into
an
error
for
two
complete
nights
and
one
day
that
on
which
patroclus
met
his
death
had
intervened
since
the
visit
of
ajax
and
ulysses
to
the
tent
of
achilles
see
also
l
l
the
terms
made
use
of
in
this
line
and
in
may
appear
somewhat
coarse
as
addressed
by
one
goddess
to
another
but
i
assure
the
english
reader
that
in
this
passage
especially
i
have
greatly
softened
down
the
expression
of
the
original
a
literal
translation
of
which
however
forcible
would
shock
even
the
least
fastidious
critic
it
must
indeed
be
admitted
that
the
mode
in
which
the
white
armed
goddess
proceeds
to
execute
her
threat
is
hardly
more
dignified
than
the
language
in
which
it
is
conveyed
is
refined
line
they
being
two
while
i
was
only
one
such
i
believe
to
be
the
true
interpretation
of
this
passage
which
however
is
one
of
admitted
difficulty
according
to
our
modern
notions
it
is
not
very
evident
what
advantage
two
men
in
a
car
would
have
over
one
in
another
nor
what
would
be
gained
by
the
division
of
labour
which
assigned
the
reins
to
one
and
the
whip
to
the
other
but
such
from
line
appears
to
have
been
the
view
taken
